# Oracle Database Monitoring Extension

The Oracle Database is an object-relational database management system.

The Oracle Database monitoring extension captures performance metrics from Oracle databases
(version 10g and above) and displays them in AppDynamics. The extension comes with a standard set of queries
that gather metrics based on the following categories.

-   Activity: Throughput over the last minute, such as transactions, SQL executes, I/O reads and writes, average active sessions, etc.
-   Resource Utilization: What database resources are currently in use (sessions, open cursors, shared pool, etc).
-   Efficiency: Ratios and response times as indicators of the instance's efficiency.
